				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>This is the Privacy Policy of HIGH END PTY LIMITED ABN 80 634 474 383 (“HIGH END”, “we”, “us” and when relating to us, “our”). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our contacts, customers, suppliers, and employees (“you” and when relating to you, “your”) and complying with the Australian Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>). This Privacy Policy details in general terms how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information under the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
					<p>HIGH END collects, stores, and uses your personal information as a data controller in connection with the use of the services we provide in our stores or on the HIGH END website (<strong>“Services”</strong>) according to this privacy policy (<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>).</p>
					<p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy as amended from time to time is available on this website.</p>
				</blockquote>	
				<h3>Information We Collect About You</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I. The kinds of personal information that we collect include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>your name, residential and delivery addresses, telephone numbers, email and other electronic addresses;</li>
						<li>your date of birth and gender;</li>
						<li>commercial information, like products you purchased, considered, or viewed on the HIGH END website or app; </li>
						<li>information about any feedback you provide, complaints you make and details of any products returned, and refunds provided, to you;</li>
					</ul>	
	 				<p>II. Other information we collect generally includes:</p>
	 				<p>Website Browsing Information. When you visit the HIGH END website, app or any of our social media sites, we track information to assist us administering the website and analysing website usage. This information includes:</p>
	 				<ul>
	 					<li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address; </li>
	 					<li>the state or country from which you access the website;</li>
	 					<li>date and time of your visit to the website; </li>
	 					<li>the kind of browser or computer you use;</li>
	 					<li>name of your Internet service provider; </li>
	 					<li>web pages from which you link to our website or go to from our website; </li>
	 					<li>the webpages within our website you view when visiting our website; </li>
	 					<li>geolocation if you access our website via a mobile device. You will have the option to turn off geolocation on your mobile device, but certain features in our mobile apps may not then work properly for you. As part of website browsing tracking processes described above, we use third-party technology, namely Google Analytics. We do not knowingly provide Google with any personal information as part of using Google Analytics. Further information about the Google Analytics privacy principles can be found at: https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html.</li>
	 				</ul>
	 				<p>III. Cookies</p>
	 				<p>We use cookies to personalise or enhance your user experience and to facilitate the tracking of session and cross session activities. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
	 				<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalise a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases website navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalised functionality.</p>
	 				<p>The type of information that may be stored in a cookie includes non-personal information about you. Some examples may include a randomly assigned user or session identification number, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to the site. We reserve the right to share aggregated website statistics with third parties, but will not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into our website another site that relies on third-party cookies).</p>
	 				<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings, then be aware that this may affect the functionality of our website.</p>

					<p>We may recover from you our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to that personal information. However, we will not charge you for the making of the request or to correct or update your personal information. If we refuse to provide you with access to, or correct, your personal information, we will notify you of our reasons to the extent required, and what steps you may then take. </p>
